# Rules for the Cisco WLC (Wireless LAN Controller) - The Cisco WLC doesn't always send everything via syslog. 
# For example,  rogue AP detection can only be sent via snmptrap.  You will need to setup SNMP-Trap on the 
# Cisco-WLC to point to the Sagan device.   Setup snmptrapd on the Sagan device to receive the SNMP trap messages
# and forward them to syslog.  When snmptrapd is used,  Sagan will look for the OID of the offending message.
